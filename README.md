**About me**

Hi, I'm Megan, a data scientist working in the healthcare sector in London. I hold an MSc in Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Groningen. I believe there is significant untapped potential in the healthcare industry that is now being unlocked through harnessing its data capabilities. I thoroughly enjoy being a part of this rapidly evolving sector, combining my interests in healthcare, mathematics and machine learning.

**Purpose of repository**

I set up this repository to showcase examples of data science projects which I have undertaken either at university or in my own time. Projects from my job are not included due to data privacy. The main programming languages used are Python, R and SQL. Each folder includes a README file, giving details about the project. This is by no means an exhaustive portfolio, but simply a small glimpse of the type of work I am interested in.

**Data**

Various types of data are used for my projects, including time series air pollution data, blood count data, text files for NLP, genotype data, house price data and randomised controlled trial data.
Many of these datasets are extremely large. 

**Methods**

Various statistical and machine learning techniques are used to answer research questions. These include:
- Supervised machine learning (Gradient boosted regression trees, random forest, logistic regression and linear regression)
- Unsupervised machine learning (Clustering
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE,
