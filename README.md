**About me**

Hi, I'm Megan, a data scientist working in the healthcare sector in London. I hold an MSc in Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning from Imperial College London, and a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Groningen. I believe there is significant untapped potential in the healthcare industry that is now being unlocked through harnessing its data capabilities. I thoroughly enjoy being a part of this rapidly evolving sector, combining my interests in healthcare, mathematics and machine learning.

**My portfolio**

The purpose of this repository is to showcase examples of data science projects which I have undertaken either at university or in my own time. Projects from my job are not included due to data privacy. Each folder includes a README file, giving details about the project. This is by no means an exhaustive portfolio, but simply a small glimpse of the type of work I am interested in.
