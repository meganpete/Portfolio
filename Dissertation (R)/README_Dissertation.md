**Overview**
This folder contains my dissertation for the MSc Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning from Imperial College London, for which I recieved a distinction. I conducted this research along with Imperial's Environmental Research Group (ERG).

**Aim of research**
The aim of my project was to assess the efficacy of the 2021 Ultra-Low Emission Zone expansion using Breathe London Network data. Breathe London is a large network of low-cost air quality monitoring sensors, commissioned by the Mayor of London, and monitored by the ERG at Imperial (Note: the research undertaken using the data is not commisioned by the Mayor of London). The purpose of the network is to give communities access to local air quality data to be able to effectively monitor their air pollution levels in real time. This is vastly different to traditional air quality networks as it provides a much more detailed and local picture of pollution levels. More information about the network can be found at: https://www.breathelondon.org/about.

**Data**
I used mean hourly PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations from the Breathe London Network. ULEZ compliance data was used from the ULEZ Expansion 6 Month Report (https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone/ways-to-meet-the-standard).

**Methods**
The main methods I used were meteorological normalisation using boosted regression trees, linear regression, difference-in-differences modelling and change point analysis. For a more detailed explanation, please see my dissertation report, in this folder.

**Instructions**
Both the report pdf and the R code have been uploaded, but the data has been kept private. If you would like access to the data, I can request permission from the ERG, howver I cannot guarantee that permission will be granted.
